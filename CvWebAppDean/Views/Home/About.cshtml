    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h4 class="lead">A quick and small introduction about me as a person.</h4>
    <p>
        I'm Dean Anthonijsz born in the year 2000 in the city Den Helder in the Netherlands,
        i have started my mbo-4 in the beginning of 2021 and aim the finish it before the end of 2023.
        My interests have always been at programming and coding, from creating little games in python
        to creating bigger games in Unity when i was older. So far my interest has yet to settle for
        a specific topic, be it game development or web development. Both making webapps and games have
        peaked my interest so far. Though i can not confidently say what topic i want to focus on, i am certain
        that C# is so far my favourite language. Something in C# just works for me and the endless possibilities
        sure didn't make it a hard choice for me.

    <h2>Dynamic</h2>
    <p>
        One of the things that i love is being dynamic in my code, even the little things like my age right above here
        and C# gives me the ability to do that.
